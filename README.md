Aim: To study and implement Operators in C++.


Software used: VS Code.

Theory:
Operators in C++ are special symbols used to perform operations on variables and values. They are fundamental for writing expressive and functional code.
C++ operators are broadly categorized as:
- Arithmetic Operators: Perform basic calculations (+, -, *, /, %).
- Relational Operators: Compare values (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=).
- Logical Operators: Combine conditions (&&, ||, !).
- Assignment Operators: Assign and update variables (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=).
- Increment/Decrement: Modify values by one (++, --), useful in loops.
- Bitwise Operators: Operate at the binary level (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>).
- Ternary Operator: A compact form of if-else (condition ? expr1 : expr2).
- Sizeof Operator: Determines the memory size of a datatype or variable.
Understanding operator precedence and associativity ensures correct evaluation order. Mastery of operators enables efficient logic writing, especially in conditions, expressions, loops, and low-level programming like embedded systems.


Syntax:

    int a = 5, b = 2;
    int sum = a + b;        // Arithmetic
    bool isEqual = (a == b); // Relational
    bool result = (a > b && b > 0); // Logical
    a += 3;                 // Assignment
    b++;                    // Increment
    int bits = a & b;       // Bitwise
    int max = (a > b) ? a : b; // Ternary
    int size = sizeof(a);   // Sizeof

Conclusion: Operators are the backbone of C++ logic and computation. Mastering their types and syntax empowers programmers to write expressive, efficient code across conditions, calculations, and memory-level tasksâ€”essential for both everyday programs and advanced systems development.
