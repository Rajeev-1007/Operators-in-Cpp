Aim: To study and implement Operators in C++.


Software used: VS Code.

Theory:
C++ provides a rich set of operators that perform various operations on data. Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %) handle basic math, while relational operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=) compare values. Logical operators (&&, ||, !) are used in decision-making constructs like if and while. Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=) update variable values, and bitwise operators (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>) manipulate binary data directly. C++ also supports increment/decrement (++, --), conditional (?:), and comma (,) operators for advanced usage. The sizeof operator determines memory usage, and type cast operators convert data types. Operators can be overloaded within classes to define custom behaviors. Mastery of these operators enhances code efficiency, clarity, and flexibility across applications.


Conclusion: C++ operators enable efficient data manipulation, logic control, and decision-making. Mastering them ensures cleaner code, optimized performance, and enhanced problem-solving across diverse applications.
